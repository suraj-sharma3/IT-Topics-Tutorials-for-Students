    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <!-- 
        The "charset" attribute specifies the character encoding for the HTML document.
        UTF-8 is the most widely used character encoding format and supports almost all characters, symbols, and languages.
        It ensures that special characters (e.g., ñ, é, Ω) are displayed correctly.
        Without this meta tag, characters might render incorrectly, especially for multilingual content.
        Example: The word “café” would display correctly because UTF-8 supports the accented 'é'.

    <!-- 
        The "viewport" meta tag controls how a web page is displayed on mobile devices.
        - name="viewport": Targets the viewport, the visible area of a web page on a device.
        - content="width=device-width": Sets the width of the viewport to match the device's screen width.
        - content="initial-scale=1.0": Sets the initial zoom level to 1.0 (no zoom applied).
        Purpose:
        - Makes the page responsive by adjusting the layout to fit different screen sizes, such as phones, tablets, and desktops.
        - Prevents the page from appearing "zoomed out" or incorrectly scaled on mobile devices.
        Example: Resize the browser window or view on a smartphone, and the layout will adjust dynamically.
